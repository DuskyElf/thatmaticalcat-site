# Introduction
In this blog, I will tell you about all the type system tricks I know and how I encorporated all those tricks into https://github.com/thatmagicalcat/tcrts.

## The Goal
Lol it's fairly obvious, we'll abuse rust's type system what else?

## The Plan
The most important thing for abusing the type system is to have a good understanding of recursion.
We are going to use recursion to create a set of types that can be used to represent a set of values, datastructure like list, tuple, etc. 

## The Basics
Let's start with the numbers, we are going to represent the numbers using types.
Let's start with the number zero.
```rust
struct Zero;
```

No we aren't going to create a struct for every number, that would be stupid.
Instead, we are going to use a recursive type to represent the numbers.

What I mean is, for 1 can be written as 0 + 1, 2 can be written as 0 + 1 + 1, and so on.

```rust
// we'll have to use PhantomData marker as
// we are not going to use the generic type T
struct Next<T>(std::marker::PhantomData<T>);
```

And now we can represent the numbers as follows:
```rust
type One = Next<Zero>;
type Two = Next<One>;
type Three = Next<Two>;
// and so on
```

Currently the `Next<T>` and `Zero` are two separate structs, we'll define a trait called `Num` to unify them, this crate won't do anything but it'll help us with the implementation of traits.

```rust
trait Num {}

// and implement the trait for both types
impl Num for Zero {}
impl<T: Num> Num for Next<T> {}

// We're also gonna change the `Next` struct's
// definition to include the `Num` trait bound
struct Next<T: Num>(std::marker::PhantomData<T>);
```

Ok but let's say we have a very long type chain, for example `Next<Next<Next<..Next<Zero>..>>>`, how do we get the actual value from this type?
Surely we are not going to count the number of `Next` types manually. For checking the value of the type, let's define a trait called `ToVal` 
that will convert the type to a value which we can print.
```rust
trait ToVal {
    const VALUE: usize;
}
```

Yup you guessed it, it is going to be a recursive definition.
In any recursive definition, we need a base case, and this implementation the base case is `Zero`.
```rust
impl ToVal for Zero {
    const VALUE: usize = 0;
}
```

And now we can implement the `ToVal` trait for `Next<T>` as follows:
```rust
impl<N: ToVal> ToVal for Next<N> {
    const VALUE: usize = 1 + N::VALUE;
}
```

We can test that this works by running the following code:
```rust
fn main() {
    type One = Next<Zero>;
    type Two = Next<One>;
    type Three = Next<Two>;

    assert_eq!(One::VALUE, 1);
    assert_eq!(Two::VALUE, 2);
    assert_eq!(Three::VALUE, 3);
}
```

And it works! Now we're done with the basics, let's move on to the next part and define some operations which we can perform on these number types.

## Arithmetic operations
For our arithmetic operations, we are going to use [Peano Axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms), which are a set of axioms for the natural numbers that can be used to define operations like addition, subtraction and multiplication in a recursive way.

> ### Addition
Before jumping into the type system implementation, let's define the addition operation using the Peano Axioms.
The addition operation is defined as follows:

Let's define a function `S(x) = x + 1` (this is our `Next` struct from above).

Our base cases are going to be:
```math
a + 0 = a \tag{1}
```
```math
a + S(b) = S(a + b)        \tag{2}
```
Which is fairly obvious, as addition is commutative, that means, a + (b + 1) is same as (a + b) + 1. We did the same thing above.

Let's try to create a recursive definition for simple examples first:
```math
\begin{align*}
a + 1 &= a + S(0) \\
      &= S(a + 0) &\text{using (1)} \\
      &= S(a) &\text{using (2)} \\

a + 1 &= S(a) \tag{3}
\end{align*}
```

```math
\begin{align*}
a + 2 &= a + S(1) \\
      &= S(a + 1) &\text{using (2)} \\
      &= S(S(a)) &\text{using (3)} \\
a + 2 &= S(S(a))         \tag{4}
\end{align*}

```
```math
\begin{align*}
a + 3 &= a + S(2) \\
      &= S(a + 2) &\text{using (2)} \\
      &= S(S(S(a))) &\text{using (4)} \\
a + 3 &= S(S(S(a))) \tag{5}
\end{align*}
```

Now we can see a pattern here, we can generalize this for `a + n` as follows:
```math
\begin{align*}
a + n &= S(a + S(n - 1)) \\
      &= S(S(S(...S(a)...))) \\   &\text{where }S\text{ is applied }n\text{ times} \\
\end{align*}
```

With that understanding, we're ready to implement the addition operation in Rust's type system.
Let's start by defining a trait called `PeanoAdd` that will represent the addition operation.
```rust
trait PeanoAdd<Rhs: Num> {
    type Output: Num;
}
```

Base case:
```rust
// N + 0 = N
impl<N: Num> PeanoAdd<Zero> for N {
    type Output = N;
}
```

Next, we generalize the addition operation for `Next<T>` as follows:
```rust
// N + Next<M> = Next<N + Next<M - 1>>
impl<N, M> PeanoAdd<Next<M>> for N
where
    N: Num + PeanoAdd<M>,
    M: Num,
{ 
    type Output = Next<<N as PeanoAdd<M>>::Output>;
}
```
Notice that we're doing `<N as PeanoAdd<M>>` but out trait is `PeanoAdd<Next<M>>` what this means is we're basically doing `M - 1`, which we can't do directly in Rust system

We can test our addition operation by running the following code:
```rust
type _0 = Zero;
type _1 = Next<_0>;
type _2 = Next<_1>;
type _3 = Next<_2>;
type _4 = Next<_3>;
type _5 = Next<_4>;
type _6 = Next<_5>;
type _7 = Next<_6>;
type _8 = Next<_7>;
type _9 = Next<_8>;

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(<_5 as PeanoAdd<_6>>::Output::VALUE, _9::VALUE);

    // Remember `::VALUE` comes from the `ToValue` trait
}
```

If you're wondering how this recursive definition will actually work, I've got you covered.

You can skip the above explanation if you understand the mathematical definition of addition that we defined above, but I think it is important to understand how the recursion works in Rust's type system.
And you should be able to dry run the type system code in your head because that's the only way to debug your code.

> ### Subtraction
Subtraction kinda the same as addition but instead of adding 1,
we'll keep subtracting 1 from both of the terms until one of them becomes 0.
Here's what i mean:
Let's take an example of `5 - 3`

```math
\begin{align*}
5 - 3
 &= S(S(S(S(S(0))))) - S(S(S(0))) \\
 &= S(S(S(S(0)))) - S(S(0)) \\
 &= S(S(S(0))) - S(0) \\
 &= S(S(0)) - 0 \\
 &= S(S(0)) \\
 &= 2 \\
\end{align*}
```

As you can see we're basically removing the `S` function from both terms until the right term becomes `0`, and if we reach `0` for left term first, we'll have a negative number which is a problem as we don't really have a way to deal with.

Since the I already the explained the concept above, i'll jump straight into the code:


The trait:
```rust
trait PeanoSub<N: Num> {
    type Output: Num;
}
```


Base case
```rust
// N - 0 = N
impl<N: Num> PeanoSub<Zero> for N {
    type Output = N;
}
```

Recursive definition:
```rust
// Next<N> - Next<M> = N - M
impl<N, M> PeanoSub<Next<M>> for Next<N>
where
    N: Num + PeanoSub<M>,
    M: Num,
{
    type Output = <N as PeanoSub<M>>::Output;
}
```

You can see the similarity, the implementation is defined on `Next<M>` and `Next<N>`, so using `N` and `M` in the recurive definition is same as converting `S(a) -> a`.

> ### Multiplication
Multiplication is kinda the hardest thing to figure, it took me a while to come up with a recursive definition that would work with rust's type system, here it is:

Here's the definition
```math
\begin{align*}
a \times n &= a + (a \times (n - 1))  \tag{6} \\
a \times 0 &= 0\\
\end{align*}
```

Here's how it looks like:
```math
\begin{align*}
a \times b       &= a + (a \times (b - 1)) \\
a \times (b - 1) &= a + (a \times (b - 2)) \\
a \times (b - 2) &= a + (a \times (b - 3)) \\
a \times (b - 3) &= a + (a \times (b - 4)) \\
&\vdots\\
a \times 3 &= a + (a \times 2) \\
a \times 2 &= a + (a \times 1) \\
a \times 1 &= a + (a \times 0) \\
a \times 0 &= 0 \\
\end{align*}
```

Now we unwind the stack

```math
\begin{align*}
a \times 1 &= a \\
a \times 2 &= a + a \\
a \times 3 &= a + a + a \\
a \times 4 &= a + a + a + a \\
a \times b &= \underbrace{a + a + \dots + a + a}_{b\text{ terms}} \\
\end{align*}
```

Now let's implement multiplication in rust

The trait:
```rust
trait PeanoMul<N: Num> {
    type Output: Num;
}
```

Base case:
```rust
// N * 0 = 0
impl<N: Num> PeanoMul<Zero> for N {
    type Output = Zero;
}
```

Recursive definition:
```rust
impl<N, M> PeanoMul<Next<M>> for N
where
    N: Num + PeanoMul<M> + PeanoAdd<<N as PeanoMul<M>>::Output>,
    M: Num,
    <N as PeanoMul<M>>::Output: Num,
{
    type Output = <
        N as PeanoAdd< // N +
            <N as PeanoMul<M> // N * (M - 1)
        >::Output>
    >::Output;
}
```

And now we can use it like the following:
```rust
fn main() {
    type Product = <_3 as PeanoMul<_3>>::Output;

    assert_eq!(Product::VALUE, _9::VALUE);
}
```

## Boolean types
Ok this is going to be easy, try to implement boolean and boolean operations yourself.

Trait and structs:
```rust
trait Boolean {
    // will be helpful when implementing
    // binary operations
    type Value: Num, 
}

struct True;
struct False
```

Implementations
```rust
impl Boolean for True {
    type Value = Next<Zero>;
}

impl Boolean for False {
    type Value = Zero;
}

impl<B> ToVal for b
where
    B: Boolean,
    B::Value: ToVal
{
    const VALUE: usize = B::Value::VALUE;
}
```

The implementaiton of binary operations is kinda self explanatory so I guess I'll just drop the rust code.

I am implement the operations in a very simple way because otherwise I'll have to add type contrains, as an exercise, try to implement NAND gate and then define all other binary operations using that.

> ### NOT
```rust
trait Not {
    type Output: Boolean;
}

impl Not for True  { type Output = False; }
impl Not for False { type Output = True;  }
```

> ### AND
```rust
trait And<B: Boolean> {
    type Output: Boolean;
}

impl And<False> for False { type Output = False; }
impl And<True>  for False { type Output = False; }
impl And<False> for True  { type Output = False; }
impl And<True>  for True  { type Output = True;  }
```

> ### OR
```rust
trait Or<B: Boolean> {
    type Output: Boolean;
}

impl Or<False> for False { type Output = False; }
impl Or<True>  for False { type Output = True;  }
impl Or<False> for True  { type Output = True;  }
impl Or<True>  for True  { type Output = True;  }
```

> ### XOR
```rust
trait Xor<B: Boolean> {
    type Output: Boolean;
}

impl Xor<False> for False { type Output = False; }
impl Xor<True>  for True  { type Output = False; }
impl Xor<False> for True  { type Output = True;  }
impl Xor<True>  for False { type Output = True;  }
```

> ### NAND
```rust
trait NAnd<B: Boolean> {
    type Output: Boolean;
}

impl NAnd<False> for False { type Output = True;  }
impl NAnd<True>  for False { type Output = True;  }
impl NAnd<False> for True  { type Output = True;  }
impl NAnd<True>  for True  { type Output = False; }
```

## Comparisons

> ### Equality
Let `Eq` be a function defined recursively by:
```math
\begin{align*}
Eq(0, 0) &= \text{true} \\
Eq(S(a), 0) &= \text{false} \\
Eq(0, S(b)) &= \text{false} \\
Eq(S(a), S(b)) &= Eq(a, b) \\
\end{align*}
```

Now we just have to translate this logic to our rust code:
```rust
trait PeanoEq<N> {
    type Output: Boolean;
}

// Eq(a, 0) = false
impl<N: Num> PeanoEq<Zero> for Next<N> {
    type Output = False;
}

// Eq(0, a) = false
impl<N: Num> PeanoEq<Next<N>> for Zero {
    type Output = False;
}

// Eq(0, 0) = true
impl PeanoEq<Zero> for Zero {
    type Output = True;
}

// Eq(S(a), S(b)) = Eq(a, b)
impl<N, M> PeanoEq<Next<M>> for Next<N>
where
    N: Num + PeanoEq<M>,
    M: Num,
{
    type Output = <N as PeanoEq<M>>::Output;
}
```

And with that, we can also define our `PeanoNEq` as follows:
```rust
trait PeanoNEq<N> {
    type Output: Boolean;
}

impl<N: Num, M: Num> PeanoNEq<N> for M
where
    N: PeanoEq<M>,
    <N as PeanoEq<M>>::Output: Not,
{
    type Output = <<N as PeanoEq<M>>::Output as Not>::Output;
}
```
